## Week 4 of the Headstarter Fellowship: Building AI FlashWord

During Week 4 of the Headstarter Fellowship, our team of four developed **AI FlashWord**, an innovative AI-driven flashcard website. Leveraging the power of the Stripe API, OpenAI, Firebase Firestore, and Next.js, we created a platform where users can generate custom flashcards on any topic or directly from an uploaded PDF.

### AI FlashWord offers a tiered experience:

- **Free users** can create AI-generated flashcards tailored to their needs.
- **Premium users** unlock additional features, including the ability to generate and study larger decks, create quizzes, and access an unlimited number of decks.

Our project blends cutting-edge technology with education, providing an enhanced learning experience for users at every level.
